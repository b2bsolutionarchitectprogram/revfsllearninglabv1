 Org Setup

Sign up for a CPQ org

To complete this lab, you need a special Developer Edition org that contains Salesforce CPQ and our sample data. Get the free Developer Edition and connect it to Trailhead now so you can complete the challenges in this module.
Even if you've recently signed up for a special CPQ-enabled Developer Edition org, sign up for new one now. We're always adding new data. Also note that the Salesforce CPQ managed package expires after 90 days, so you may need a new org anyway.

1. Sign up for a free Developer Edition org with Salesforce CPQ (https://developer.salesforce.com/promotions/orgs/cpqtrails).
    1. https://developer.salesforce.com/promotions/orgs/cpqtrails
2. Fill out the form. For Email, enter an active email address. For Username, enter a username that looks like an email address and is unique, but it doesn't need to be a valid email account (for example, yourname@cpq4ever.com).
3. After you fill out the form, click *Sign me up*. A confirmation message appears.
4. When you receive the activation email (this might take a few minutes), open it and click *Verify Account.*
5. Complete your registration by setting your password and challenge question. *Tip*: Write down your username, password, and login URL for easy access later.
6. You are logged in to your Developer Edition.

Enable Field Service

Before you can start working with Field Service, you must enable it.

1. In your CPQ org , click  then select *Setup*.
2. Enter field service in the Quick Find box, then select *Field Service Settings*.
3. Click the toggle to enable Field Service.

Look at all the shiny new settings! For now, leave those settings alone—you can adjust them all you want after you finish the project.

Install the FSL Managed Package

Now you’re ready to install the goodness of the Field Service Managed package right into your Trailhead playground. Salesforce regularly releases new versions of the Field Service managed package as part of their standard Spring, Summer, and Winter releases so it will be up-to-date.

1. Open an incognito browser window in Chrome.
2. In the incognito window, paste this link https://fsl.secure.force.com/install into the address bar to install the managed package.
3. Click the link to install the most recent managed package to your Trailhead playground production org. For a business org, you may want to install new packages in a sandbox org first to test them. If you get an error message saying the managed package isn't yet available on your Trailhead playground, please try completing this project again in a few days.
4. On the Salesforce login screen, enter the username and password for your Trailhead Playground, then click *Log In*.
5. Select *Install for Admins Only*, then click *Install*.
6. Approve the request to grant access to third-party websites for geolocation and optimization services.
7. Wait for a message telling you that you’ll be notified by email when the package is installed, and click *Done*. Spend a few minutes doing something fabulous while you’re waiting for the email.
